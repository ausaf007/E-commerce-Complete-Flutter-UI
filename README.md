## About The Project

Tech Advisor is an E-Commerce app that simplifies your shopping experience by providing the most relevant tech products in a specific category.  

Tech Advisor was forked from [abuanwar072's](https://github.com/abuanwar072) E-commerce-Complete-Flutter-UI [codebase](https://github.com/abuanwar072/E-commerce-Complete-Flutter-UI). It uses a simplified version of this UI, with added user authentication functionality enabled through Google Firebase.
